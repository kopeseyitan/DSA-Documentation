This is where I started my portfolio while taking my Data Analysis Class with the Incubator

I have learnt several things from Excel to SQL, and now to portfolio building

## Project Topic: E Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of
The e-commerce project over the past Year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received,
we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions, which then enable us to tell compelling
stories around our data from the insight gained, and to know the best performance from our data

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is data sales.csv, and this is an open-source dataset that can be freely
downloaded from an open-source online site such as Kaggle, Fred, or any other data repository site

### Tools used
- Ms Excel for data cleaning [Download here]{https://excel.cloud.microsoft/new/?wdOrigin=new.apphome.excel}
  - for data collection
  - for data cleaning
    1. Data Manipulation
    2. Data Munching
- SQL Server (for Querying and Analysis)
- Power BI ( for creating a report)
- Ms PowerPoint (for presentation)

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we perform the following actions
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves exploring the data to answer questions about the data, such as
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which products are top sellers
- What are the products on peak sales

Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines, queries, or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis
 ```    SQL
SELECT A,B,C
WHERE A > 45
 ```
